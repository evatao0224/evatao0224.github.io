My name is Peiyuan Tao. Here are a few things you might be interested about me:

- I've worked on 20+ games
- I've played 300+ games
- I'm a Geoguessr player, if you know what that is :)
- I speak 4 languages: English, Chinese, Spanish and Japanese

The list will be updated (hopefully) on a monthly basis.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
