Hi there!

Here're a few things about me that you may find interesting:

- **I've provided localization service to more than 20 games** with teams around the world with different cultural backgrounds.
- I speak 3 languages: English, Chinese, and Spanish. And I'm currently learning Japanese and French as well.
- I firmly believe that [_The Witness_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/) by Jonathan Blow is one of the greatest works that humans could ever create.
- I'm also a Geoguessr player, if you know what that is :)


This list will be updated (hopefully) on a monthly basis.

If you're interested in collaborating or simply talking about games or language-learning, feel free to contact me through the email button at the bottom of the page.
