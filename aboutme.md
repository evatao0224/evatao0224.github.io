Hi there!

Here are a few things about me that you may find interesting:

- **I've worked on 20+ games** with teams around the world with different cultural backgrounds.
- Among the 300+ games I've played, my favorite one has always been [_The Witness_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/210970/The_Witness/) by Jonathan Blow.
- I'm a Geoguessr player, if you know what that is :)
- I speak 3 languages: English, Chinese, and Spanish. I'm currently learning Japanese and French as well.

The list will be updated (hopefully) on a monthly basis.
